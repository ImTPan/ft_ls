# ft_ls

My implementation of the unix command 'ls' to list the contents of directories.

The only dependencies are:
- GNU Make
- GCC

### Usage:

Run `./ft_ls` instead of `ls` after you have built the source code.
Can be run with any of the following flags:
```
-l For long format listing and additional information
-r Reverse sort
-t Displays newest files first (By date of modification)
-R Recursively displays files and subdirectories
-a Displays hidden files.
```

### Notes

- The instructions for this project are here, we are limited in our use of functions: 
[ft_ls @42US](https://github.com/tpan/ft_ls/blob/master/ft_ls.en.pdf)
- Lack of comments is something i would improve upon.
- I also disagree with norm compliant comments, I prefer them to be inline but that goes against the norm [42Norm](https://github.com/tpan/ft_ls/blob/master/norme.en.pdf)
